## My i3 window manager

I pretty much use the default window manager settings. The only thing I configure is my status line
and some of the key bindings to some specific applications that I use often.

## My i3blocks configuration

i3blocks is a feed generator for text based status bars. It executes your command lines and 
generates a status line from their output.

Its what i use to customize my i3 window manager status line.

I use some of the configurations from [this repo](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks-contrib)
it has a very useful premade scripts to customize your status line as you wish. For example my
`/shutdown_menu` folder.

Huge thanks to the community that helps maintain and update them.
